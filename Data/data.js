        Prime Video released the teaser for Eddie Murphy’s first holiday film on Thursday — offering a fuller look at the adventure comedy where Christmas wishes go awry. The film reunites the actor and comedian with director Reginald Hudlin and producer Brian Grazer for the first time since 1992’s Boomerang. 
        Murphy stars as Chris Carver, a man on a mission to win his annual Christmas home decoration contest — a desire not shared by his rather exasperated family. But when he and his youngest daughter stumble upon a Christmas store, his dream of “the best Christmas ever” — winning the contest — becomes a nightmare after an elf named Pepper (Jillian Bell) grants his wish, literally.`

        Ekta Singhwal, dietician at Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, explained that these snacks play a crucial role in enhancing performance and promoting overall well-being while you’re exercising.
        Your body needs a readily available source of energy when you work out and healthy snacking provides this energy in the form of carbohydrates. For those who don’t know, carbohydrates are the body’s preferred fuel source during moderate to high-intensity activities, like a workout.
        The dizziness you feel during your workout sometimes happens when your blood sugar levels drop too low. Pre-workout snacks can also help stabilise blood sugar levels, important for maintaining energy and preventing fatigue during your workout.`,

This incident underscores the critical need for precision in the realm of food delivery and sparks questions about the accountability of food delivery platforms in guaranteeing order accuracy.
        The episode in question transpired when a customer placed an order from McDonald's, with Zomato overseeing the delivery process. Upon receipt of the order, the customer was taken aback to find that non-vegetarian items had been mistakenly substituted for the vegetarian dishes they had initially ordered. The customer's dissatisfaction led them to file a formal complaint with the District Commission.`,

        desc: `In celebration of World Egg Day, let's explore three fantastic protein-rich foods that are great alternatives for those seeking a high-protein diet:
        <br>
        <b>1. Eggs</b>:
        Eggs are a powerhouse of nutrition, providing high-quality protein and a wide range of essential vitamins and minerals. A single large egg contains about 6 grams of protein, making it a versatile and popular choice for meeting protein needs. Whether boiled, scrambled, poached, or used in baking and cooking, eggs are a convenient and delicious protein source.
        <br/>
        <b>2. Quinoa</b>:
        Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own. A cup of cooked quinoa contains approximately 8 grams of protein, making it an excellent plant-based protein option for vegetarians and vegans. Quinoa is versatile and can be used in salads, bowls, or as a side dish.
        <br/>
        <b>3. Greek Yogurt</b>:
        Greek yogurt is a protein-packed dairy product that offers about 10-15 grams of protein per 100 grams, making it a protein-dense food. It is lower in lactose compared to regular yogurt due to the straining process, making it easier to digest for some individuals. Greek yogurt can be enjoyed on its own, mixed with fruits and nuts, or used in smoothies and various recipes.`,

As expected, the excitement is palpable and Dharma Productions, the producers, have decided to celebrate the anniversary in a grand fashion. A few hours ago, the social media handle of the production house, announced that a special screening of the film will be held on Sunday, October 15. The booking was soon opened and in no time, the shows got sold out.
        An exhibition source told Bollywood Hungama, “The low price point must have played a part. It’s unbelievable for moviegoers that they will get to see the film in a swanky multiplex for just Rs. 25. Moreover, the film has a charm and is timeless. Many moviegoers were too young or were not even born when it was released in 1998. Hence, they either don’t vividly remember or have never seen the film on the big screen. And of course, Shah Rukh Khan’s presence in the lead along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji and association of Karan Johar as the director, all of whom are going strong even today, also must have been another reason why the shows got house full immediately.”
        The source continued, “Nevertheless, no one expected such reception to the re-release of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. There was no prior intimation. The booking began all of a sudden and yet, such was the response.”
        As per another source, one more show of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai will be added in the same theatre, that is, PVR Icon Versova. It now remains to be seen if more shows of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai are added not just in other PVR theatres Mumbai but also in other cities. `

A report from 9to5Mac claims that the company will unveil its latest set of iPad lineup, which is slated to take place on October 17. The cited source says the news has been confirmed by multiple sources. Here are the details.If the leak is to be believed, the forthcoming announcement is set to focus primarily on the iPad Air, iPad mini, and the base model iPad. Apple might just make cosmetic changes to the design and the new iPads are said to get upgrades in terms of hardware. So, one can expect to get performance improvements.
        The existing iPad Air, which was launched nearly three years ago, is currently powered by the formidable M1 chip. Apple's next move is expected to involve upgrading this model to the M2 chip, promising a notable boost in performance and efficiency.
        The iPad mini, on the other hand, is set to receive an upgrade to the A16 Bionic chip, a subtle yet significant enhancement over its current A15 Bionic chip. This upgrade aims to address the "jelly scrolling" issue that has plagued some users of the current iPad mini, promising a smoother and more responsive scrolling experience.`,

Responding to the question, he said, “I think having an iPhone every year for those people that want it is a great thing."

Even though the exact number of impacted employees hasn't yet been known, many people came forward to share their side of the story. While announcing the layoffs, Alphabet had said that the decision to let go of "a few hundred" employees was not a "part of a wide-scale layoff". The company had also said that it will "retain a significant majority of the team for hiring critical roles". In addition to this, Alphabet announced helping the impacted employees to look for other roles from "within the company and elsewhere".Sharing about their experience of working at Google, some former employees wrote on LinkedIn that they will be missing their colleagues and workplace. Others, meanwhile, were grateful to have had the opportunity of working at the tech giant. One such employee wrote on LinkedIn that he wanted to work at the company till his retirement.

        Beginning his post, the man wrote that he thought that he would be working at Google till he retires. However, he was affected by the recent mass layoffs carried out at the company. The man also mentions how the layoffs were not related to performance and that he got the news right before heading into the second half of his paternity leave.
        Ending his note on a rather positive note, the ex-Google employee wrote that he would come back and work for the company '"in a fraction of a heartbeat" and that it is a "magical place with remarkable people."`,

        According to a TOI report, the victim, Malla Jyothirmayi got Rs 15 lakh deposited in her bank account by her father in September. The money was transferred via WhatsApp. When she was approached for a part-time job offer at an IT firm, the young IT graduate was keen on joining. She was asked to pay a registration fee of Rs 5,000 to initiate the hiring formalities. She then received messages from the fraudsters asking for more money for the examination of her bank account.
        After that, she was assured by the fraudsters that she would get Rs 1.4 lakh within three months if she paid 1 lakh as a caution deposit. Jyothirmayi fell into their trap and transferred a total of Rs 12.84 lakh to the fraudsters within hours. When the scammers asked her to transfer another Rs 4 lakh, the woman suspected that something was amiss. After she told her brother about the incident, he asked her not to send any more money to the fraudsters and a complaint was lodged at Anakapalli town police station.`,

        The episode in question transpired when a customer placed an order from McDonald's, with Zomato overseeing the delivery process. Upon receipt of the order, the customer was taken aback to find that non-vegetarian items had been mistakenly substituted for the vegetarian dishes they had initially ordered.

Hence, Threads was perceived to be Meta's Twitter alternative. The app got millions of downloads within 5 days of its launch and allowed people to seamlessly create a Threads account if they were already using Instagram. It was also reported that Threads might replace X altogether. However, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri had said in an interaction that the idea behind Threads was not to replace Twitter, but to give users a 'less angry' platform.However now, Threads doesn't appear to be as popular as it had been at the time of its launch. And Meta is seemingly working towards a fix by launching new features for its micro-blogging platform. Yet another feature, similar to Elon Musk's X, will be coming to Threads shortly.

It has a lower prevalence of risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and changes associated with upper chambers of the heart than atrial fibrillation known prior to the stroke. This could potentially explain its association with a decreased risk of another ischaemic stroke, which results from a blocked artery.`,

        Navigating the grocery store with a weight management perspective involves making thoughtful choices and planning. Here's how:
        
        Plan Your Shopping List Ahead of Time
        One of the fundamental strategies for successful grocery shopping is planning your list.

Plan your meals for the week and make a detailed list of the items you need to prepare them.
        
        Prioritize Fresh Produce
        Load your cart with a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables. They are low in calories, high in nutrients, and packed with fibre, helping you feel full and satisfied for longer. Opt for fresh, seasonal produce, and consider exploring local farmers' markets for the freshest options.
        Opt for Lean Proteins

Check out the bad walking habits that you need to quit.Walking is a type of exercise that seems to be pretty easy. You don’t need to go to a gym or lift heavy weights or use any other equipment. Although it may seem straightforward, many people tend to make mistakes when walking. Bad walking habits can negatively impact your comfort, health and overall walking experience. So, before you tie up your laces and get ready to walk, find out the bad walking habits that you need to quit. 1. Improper footwear
        Incorrect footwear can cause discomfort and even harm, says fitness expert Aminder Singh of Team Aminder. Make sure your shoes are well-fitting, comfortable and have enough front width for your toes to spread naturally. This way there will be less chances of you getting blisters and other foot-related problems.2. Poor posture
        Proper posture must always be maintained for effective walking. Maintain a straight posture and refrain from slouching. This encourages improved breathing, eases back tension, and improves balance in general.3. Looking down
        When walking, many people have a tendency to stare down at their feet or mobile devices, which can strain your neck and back and cause you to become less aware of your surroundings.4. Inadequate arm swing
        A coordinated arm swing is part of good walking form. You should move your arms against your legs. This coordinated arm swing improves your walking efficiency while also assisting you in keeping your balance and rhythm.5. Inadequate water intake
        Even while performing a basic exercise like walking, being hydrated is important. If you get dehydrated, you can end up with weariness and cramping in the muscles. Carry a water bottle with you and sip from it frequently to maintain proper hydration.`,

        desc: `The belief that cutting pumpkin (or certain vegetables) is forbidden for women in some cultures or communities is often rooted in traditional or cultural practices rather than a universal or scientifically validated restriction. It's important to note that these beliefs and practices can vary widely across different regions and societies.
        <br/>
        In some cultures, specific prohibitions related to cutting or handling certain foods, including pumpkin, by women may be tied to cultural or religious customs. These practices may have historical origins that are deeply ingrained in societal norms and expectations. It's crucial to approach such practices with sensitivity and respect for cultural diversity.
        <br/>
        One potential historical explanation for such prohibitions could be related to traditional gender roles, where certain tasks were assigned based on gender. For example, cutting or handling certain foods might have been considered a task traditionally performed by men, and these roles may have been passed down through generations.
        <br/>
        Over time, societies evolve, and perspectives on gender roles and responsibilities change. Many cultures have challenged and revised traditional beliefs and practices to promote gender equality and inclusivity. It's essential to foster understanding, open dialogue, and education to question and address any restrictive beliefs or practices that perpetuate gender inequalities.
        <br/>
        In conclusion, the belief that cutting pumpkin is forbidden for women is rooted in cultural or traditional practices and may not have a universally agreed-upon rationale. It's important to approach these beliefs with an open mind, understanding their historical context and considering the evolving perspectives on gender roles and responsibilities in various societies.`,

        <br>
        <b> Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia) </b>:
        Bitter melon, commonly used in Asian and Indian cuisines, is well-known for its potential to lower blood sugar levels. It contains compounds that mimic the action of insulin, helping to improve glucose uptake and utilization in the body. Bitter melon can be consumed in various forms, such as stir-fries, soups, or as a juice.

        <br>
        <b> Kale </b>:
        Kale is another leafy green vegetable packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It has a low glycemic index and can help stabilize blood sugar levels. The fiber in kale slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, preventing rapid spikes in blood sugar. Add kale to salads, stir-fries, or use it in soups for a nutritious boost.
        <br>
        <b>Brussels Sprouts </b>:
        Brussels sprouts are a cruciferous vegetable rich in fiber and antioxidants. The fiber content aids in slowing down digestion and helps regulate blood sugar levels.

        <b>Broccoli </b>:
        Broccoli is a versatile vegetable that offers numerous health benefits, including potential blood sugar control. It is low in calories and carbohydrates while being high in fiber, which supports blood sugar management.

        <br>
        Including a variety of these vegetables in your diet, along with a balanced meal plan and regular physical activity, can contribute to better blood sugar management.

        <br>
        Miso soup is typically made from a fermented paste of soybeans, rice or barley, salt, and koji (a type of fungus).

Eating food in Sukhasana posture is considered a healthy habit for several reasons related to digestion, mindfulness, and overall well-being.
        <br/>
        Firstly, Sukhasana encourages mindful eating. The seated and grounded posture promotes a calm and focused state of mind, allowing individuals to pay full attention to their meal. Mindful eating involves being present in the moment, savoring each bite, appreciating the flavors, textures, and aromas of the food. This mindful approach to eating can lead to better digestion and improved satisfaction from the meal.
        <br/>
        Secondly, Sukhasana aids in digestion. Sitting cross-legged on the floor while eating aligns the digestive tract in a natural and comfortable position. This posture allows the body to relax, and gravity assists in the smooth flow of food through the digestive system. Additionally, it may help prevent indigestion, bloating, and discomfort that can occur when eating in a hunched or slouched position.`,

        desc: `The dal chawal (lentils and rice) combination is a popular and traditional staple in many South Asian cuisines. When considering its benefits for weight loss, several factors come into play, making it a favorable option for those aiming to manage their weight effectively.
        <br>
        Firstly, dal chawal is a balanced and wholesome meal that provides a good mix of carbohydrates, proteins, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Lentils (dal) are rich in protein and fiber, which contribute to a feeling of fullness and satiety, helping to control appetite and prevent overeating. The protein-fiber combination also helps regulate blood sugar levels, aiding in a more consistent energy supply and reducing cravings for unhealthy snacks.

        Furthermore, lentils are a low-calorie, nutrient-dense food. They provide essential nutrients such as iron, potassium, folate, and various B vitamins, promoting overall health while supporting weight loss goals. Additionally, lentils have a low glycemic index, which means they don't cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, helping to manage insulin levels and reduce fat storage.`,
